They are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should 
always show great forbearance toward grown-up people.

But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indefference.
I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy tales.
I should have liked to say: "Once upon a time there was a little prince 
who lived on a planet that was scarely any bigger than himself, and who had need of sheep..."

To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of
truth to my story.

One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject.
I make some errors, too. in the little prince height: in one place he is too tall
and in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume.
So I fumble along as best I can, not bad, not good, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.

this is line 19, henry add this line.
